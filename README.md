## Requirements

The project must be used as a part of your final portfolio. Be sure to adhere to the guidelines below.

- The products must be mainstream and professional.
- Use Create React App to create a component based application to display your former products page from the first iteration of the project.
- Create a Database that contains your products (name, description, price, etc)
- Create a node server that works with your database.
- Use that database to render products to the products page
- Your application must be deployed to the cloud using AWS. (you will need to do some research on connecting a built server and database to a deployed site).
  The website must have the following pages:
- Home Page (Static): Working slider (does not have to be the hero, can be anywhere on the home page)
- Products Page (React): 12 products with a working filter rendered from your Database. Each product should have a title, description, price, and image that is rendered from your Database
- - Working filter for price and product type
- Contact Page (Static): JavaScript form validation (or any kind of functional validation for email)
- - The form should at least include a place for name, email, and comment.
- Responsiveness
- - Both tablet and mobile and Desktop
- Each page should have a Navigation Bar and Footer with links to social media (these should be components rendered, not static).
